# Number_guesser
This Python-based Number Guessing Game allows players to guess a randomly generated number between 1 and 100. The playerâ€™s score starts at 100 and decreases by 10 points for each incorrect guess. The game provides feedback on whether the player's guess is too high or too low and allows the player to continue guessing or quit at any time.
